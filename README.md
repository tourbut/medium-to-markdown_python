# Medium to Markdown Parser and CLI Tool (Python)

This code is a Python rewrite based on the Rust code "Harshil-Jani/medium-to-markdown".

## Installation

Install directly from pip.

```
pip install medium-to-markdown-py
```

## Usage

The command-line interface (CLI) accepts a Medium blog post URL and a filename as input and generates the Markdown content.

```
medium-to-markdown <URL> <file_name> <>
```

Replace <URL> with the URL of the Medium blog post you want to convert, and <file_name> with the desired filename for the Markdown output.

## Example

```
medium-to-markdown 
```
